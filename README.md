# Drivers-SIM868E-Drivers
This is a driver for SIM868E module which has BLE, GSM and GNSS interfaces. This is still incomplete but I will add more to it. Currently this is for STM32MCU but I will soon make it independent of MCU. I have used interrupt based UART handling hence used "many" flags!. This may seem complex so you may not need so much flags so modify it according to your needs. Maybe it will help some one.
